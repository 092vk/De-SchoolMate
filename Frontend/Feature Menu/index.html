                            A todos list feature on a website is a tool that allows users to
                            create and manage a list of tasks or items that need to be
                            completed. This feature typically provides a user-friendly
                            interface for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as
                            setting due dates and priorities. Users can also mark tasks as
                            completed or uncompleted, and may be able to sort or filter
                            tasks based on various criteria, such as due date or priority
                            level. A todos list feature can be particularly useful for
                            individuals or teams who need to keep track of multiple tasks or
                            projects and want to stay organized and focused.

                            A Pomodoro timer feature on a website is a tool that helps users
                            manage their time more effectively by breaking their work or
                            study sessions into smaller, more manageable chunks. The
                            Pomodoro technique is a popular time management method that
                            involves working in 25-minute intervals, followed by short
                            breaks. The Pomodoro timer feature typically provides a
                            user-friendly interface for setting and tracking work and break
                            intervals, and may include audio or visual cues to indicate when
                            each interval has started and ended.

                        <p>
                            A note making feature on a website is a tool that allows users to create and store short
                            text-based notes or memos. This feature typically provides a user-friendly interface for
                            creating new notes, editing existing ones, and organizing notes into different categories or
                            folders. Users may also be able to add tags or labels to their notes, which can help with
                            searching and filtering. Some note making features may also allow users to format text, add
                            images or attachments, and set reminders or alarms for specific notes. A note making feature
                            can be useful for individuals or teams who want to capture and organize ideas, reminders,
                            and other information quickly and easily, and access them from anywhere with an internet
                            connection.
